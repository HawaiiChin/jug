    '''
    os.unlink(_fullname(name))

def is_locked(name):
    '''
    locked = is_locked(name)

    Returns whether a lock exists for name. Note that the answer can
    be invalid by the time this function returns. Only by trying to
    acquire the lock can you avoid race-conditions. See the get() function.
