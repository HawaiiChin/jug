- A status option (or a new command) that signals through its exit status whether it is finished. [Dec 3 2009]
- When running the status loop, the results of store lookup should be cached. If 100 tasks are all dependent on
    this one unfinished initial task, then we shouldn't query the store 100 times. [Dec 3 2009]
- Think about how to use weak references to make the results be simpler [Dec 3 2009]
- Time tasks and display them with status. This is actually very easy to implement with redis (with assynchronous
  increment operations), but not so much with a file based store, so it might be 'optional' depending on the backend.
  This could be used to give an estimate of how much time is necessary to finish [Dec 3 2009]
